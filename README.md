# Dataset
Non-commercial 5G network testbed

A real-time dataset was collected from the two Orange Pi devices deployed in the testbed, each connected to the 5G network through the Quectel RM520N-GL modules. The logs capture per-iteration CPU usage (availability), memory status, execution time, and key 5G network-state metrics retrieved from the module, including RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, bandwidth allocation, and uplink/downlink throughput.
